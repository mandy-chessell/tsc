    * Abstract
       > ODPi creates open source standards to help you use and understand data across all platforms. 
      ODPi is a non-profit organization supported by The Linux Foundation and dozens of individuals and member organizations. Members are committed to simplifying and standardizing the data ecosystem so that data can be easily and securely shared across products, platforms, and systems. Learn more about the people and organizations involved in ODPi or to access publicly available resources.
      Join us to learn about the latest approaches from ODPi Projects including Egeria, BI & AI, and OpenDS4All. You will gain insight and roadmaps about several open source projects under the ODPi umbrella that can help you with your data strategies.

    
* Project updates
  
  * OpenDS4All - John/Andre
     * First adopter - Jennifer Priestley - Kennesaw State University, George US, post graduate course
       This is linked from GitHub Page - this can be updated by adopters.
     * Hoping for new contributions on Natural Language Processing
     * Questions for using Binder - scans Github for Jupyter Notebooks and provides a runtime runtime.
       Only issue is on ensuring the right packages are available.  
     
  * ODPi BI & AI - Cupid
     * Good progress in discussion on Bridge concept - 
         * Displaying real time model training status
         * Display the result of the model compared to the others - need statistics
         * Support for story telling / business use cases
     * How should this be implemented - need a high-level framework for AI engines
     * Who are the users / personas?
         * Data Scientist?  Report Consumers?
  
  * ODPi Egeria - Mandy and Maryna
     * Development work:
       * Open lineage services and UI.
          * Horizontal lineage
          * Getting close to moving into production at ING
       * New capability for 2 way integration for IBM metadata catalogs (IGC and WKC) underway - expected completion in September.
       * FVT execution is automated in build.
       * Multi-tenant UI:
           * REX and TEX complete
           * glossary development
           * exploring/monitoring Egeria distributed ecosystem
       * Digital service lifecycle support
     * Release 2.0 shipped with change of ports to use HTTPS
     * This month added 1 new contributor and 2 new maintainers.
     * Gartner contacted LF and requested interview with Egeria leads as they are getting requests from their
     customers to provide opinion on Egeria.  Gartner contact was Jason Medd. 
     Mandy and John spoke to him for 1 hour on the project, its background, operation and capability. 
     Followed up by sending presentation on Egeria.
     * Chris Grote is working on a catalog interoperability study lead by the EDM Council (https://edmcouncil.org/?)
     They are looking at providing general principles for interoperability using Egeria as a template.
     * Competitive news: Informatica has just bought Compact solutions and is putting out a 
     [strong message on metadata integration](https://blogs.informatica.com/2020/07/02/leave-no-metadata-behind-with-ai-powered-data-catalog-advanced-scanners/). 
     Egeria is a stronger solution because it does not lock an enterprise into a single, centralized, proprietary metadata store.

* AOB 
  * Suggestion from Arun - to look at [Apache Druid](http://druid.apache.org/) as a possible integration with Egeria
  and could also have relevance to BI & AI.  Arun will send more information.
  
  * What else should we cover?
     * Share experiences on how we drive more adoption of our projects
