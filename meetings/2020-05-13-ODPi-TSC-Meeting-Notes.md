# Agenda:

* Project updates
  
  * OpenDS4All - Andre
     * Difficult time as faculties are overloaded changing to digital delivery
     * Hoping to get more engagement now the term/semester is coming to the end
     * Good feedback on the content
     * Can not view large PPT on GitHub - so copied to SlideShare
     * Academic Data Science Alliance - hope to create collaboration with OpenDS4All as similar aims.
     Met at SIG on 23rd April.  No IP concerns - so follow on meeting is planned
     * Data-8 is a set resources from Berkley - eg basic stats, hypothesis forming etc - could fill a gap
     Meeting on 30th April with good meeting of minds.  Working to creating a collaborative relationship.
     For example create cross-linking between content.
     * Prof from Uni of Virginia - created a data science school to look a DS from a liberal arts POV.
     He has written a paper and this could be useful - point of discussion for OpenDS4All TSC.
  * ODPi BI & AI - Cupid
     * Finalized participants for first stage of next deliverable - 
        * SAS, MicroStrategy and Qlik (each 1 person)
        * Microsoft and Tableau (each 2 people)
      This is a specification on the combination of AI within a BI platform.  This will create the
      directions - then on the second stage there is an aim to create an implementation which will involve
      recruit developers.  Going to look a ONYX.
  * ODPi Egeria - Mandy and Maryna
     * Release 1.7 in final stages of CI/CD pipeline. No current problems.
     * Events
         * Recorded new webinar - 28th April 2020:
           * **Building a data catalog**
           * **Abstract:** In this webinar the Egeria team will cover the differ APIs and servers that support the creation and

         * Next webinar - 26th May 2020:
           * **Building a governed data lake**
           * **Abstract:**  Data lakes provide a flexible environment for managing many types of
           data at scale. In this presentation we will cover how open metadata can increase the
           effectiveness and protection of the data lake and avoid it turning into a mighty data swamp.
