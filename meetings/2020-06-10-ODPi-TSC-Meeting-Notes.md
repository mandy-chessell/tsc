# Agenda:

* Project updates
  
  * OpenDS4All - John
     * Still working to connect with more universities - still a tough climate
       * Working with Chris on new publicity plans
       * Now potential collaborators on Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
     
  * ODPi BI & AI - Cupid
     * 2 weeks ago first meeting - full attendance :)
       * Key challenge for BI vendors
       * Still discussions on scope of bridge - some feel it may be too big
          * will look at what to include and what not to include
     * Next meeting is Friday
  
  * ODPi Egeria - Mandy and Maryna
     * Egeria dojo complete and enabled as self-study course:
        * Link to dojo: https://egeria.odpi.org/open-metadata-resources/open-metadata-tutorials/egeria-dojo/
        * YouTube playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhfwwk2gl_5Y7ZE8kHjGKyuIEZMQ5Hkfp
  
     * Release 1.8 is in release pipeline.  Major release item is management of reference data sets and mappings to
       support data validation (valid values) and data transformation (mapping values).
  
     * Last month's webinar was on using Egeria as the integration technology for a data lake. Next month (21st July), Graham Wallis will cover "All things graph" which includes how we maintain the virtual metadata graph across distributed hetrogeneous repositories and the two new graph based UIs for Egeria.
  
     * Egeria's 2nd birthday is 12th June - we are celebrating through blog and the announcement of the 2.0 "production-ready" release. 
     The major change is that platform and clients have security enabled by default - even in dev environment.
     The trick is to make this seamless, particularly for developers.
  
     * New presentation server to support multi-tenant UI entered GitHub this week. David Radley delivered the UI platform/frameworks based on react and carbon.)
     US IBM team started work on Egeria's config UI based on this framework.  Working with David.  
  
     * IBM Cognos team made a major contribution to Egeria this month.  It is a new access service for analytics modeling that will enable a Cognos server to exchange metadata with the Egeria ecosystem during the report/analytics building process.  All work being done by a single developer - will get contributor badge at least.
  
     * First drop of the Digital Service API has been contributed by Bill Bittles.  This supports the business lifecycle of a digital service and is the framework for supporting regulations such as GDPR.  DevOps integration plugs in here too.  This brings Billy closer to maintainer status for Egeria.
  
     * First drop of the Data Manager OMAS is in master.  This is the API to support both Microsoft's and Oracle's integration scenario.
  
     * Egeria master has first step to running secure by default.  Platform, clients and utilities using https and secure ports.  Next step is to enable certificate validation (all work by Nigel Jones).
  
     * Major pieces of work in progress
        * Asset Lineage and Open Lineage Services (ING team)
        * Integration daemon server (Mandy)
        * Subject area UI (David)
        * Ecosystem UI (Graham)
        * Digital service/devops (Billy)
        * Security and OpenShift operators for Egeria platform and servers (Nigel)
  
     * Consumers and external partners:
        * Had a call with Safr/Silwood on integration with discovery framework (request from SAS).
        * Gartner have requested a meeting as part of their research on Data governance and metadata management
     
* NA Open Source Summit
    * Our 90 min slot will be a joint presentation of all projects.  Andre and Cupid will provide
    charts for Mandy
