Hello Team,

To expand  Egeria uses, https://www.odpi.org/projects/egeria scope.
We need to work on where all we can fit  Egeria as a metadata store.

Currently Druid uses MySQL.

https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/dependencies/metadata-storage.html
cloudera provides enterprise support for Druid
https://www.cloudera.com/

So may be should approach Alan if we can help us get an opening with the Druid team.
What do you think?
Should I write to Alan or John you can write to him?

Also I have reviewed/reviewing other DATA PROJECTS ON  LFAI projects.
We should review these products and see opportunities where we can get Egeria to be used as Meta Data, just as we have Zookeeper that is used as cluster management tool.
We can create one standard email template.
