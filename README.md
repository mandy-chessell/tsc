# Overview

As defined in the [TSC Charter](https://www.odpi.org/odpi-tsc-charter-2), the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) oversees all technical projects hosted in the ODPi.

## What does the TSC do?

The TSC isn't here to legislate and dictate how a project runs, but does serve
to establish and maintain project life-cycles, establish criteria for a project to be
hosted by ODPi, ensure projects have the resources and tools to be successful, and resolve
conflicts or issues that any ODPi project may call them to do.

## Composition

The composition of the TSC as follows:

- Project Lead for each of the current [ODPi Active Projects](#active).
- At Large ODPi community members, with the set number equal to the number of [ODPi Active Projects](#active) plus 1

ODPi TSC At Large ODPi community members serve for a period of 1 year starting from
January 1st of each calendar year. ODPi community members consist of individuals
either participating in an ODPi project.

## Current voting members

* Mandy Chessell - ODPi Egeria lead (Chairperson)
* Cupid Chan - ODPi BI and AI lead
* Arun Nair - At Large
* Maryna Strelchuk - At Large
